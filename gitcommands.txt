After installing git, make local repository as git repository:

git init

Stage the files for first commit:

git add .            ## It stages all the files in current directory for the commit

git commit -a -m "First commit"      ##Commits all the tracked changes with the message First commit and prepares for push to remote.

git log #show previous commits

git status #Shows which branch you are on and the changes

#Staging the changes
If we makes changes to the tracked project, it does not automatically get staged for commit
use git add filename to add files which have been modified. 

git add . - will add all the files in the current directory for staging

#Skipping staging

commit -a -m "First commit" - -a option commits all the files and doesnot matter if staged or not. 

#Rollback to previous file
If you accidently make changes, or delete a file you can get it back how it was in the last commit by 

git checkout -- filename

# Merging changes between local master branch and remote origin project
git pull origin master
#This will pull the code from remote and do a merge with the local repo. If there are any inconsistencies, resolve and then try again.

#To push changes to the github
Copy the URL of the GitHub Repository
Add the remote directory with the name origin
git remote add origin remoteRepositoryURL
git remote -v #verifies the URL added
git push origin master #Pushes the changes in your local repo to github
